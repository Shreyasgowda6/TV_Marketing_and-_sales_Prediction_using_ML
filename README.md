# TV Marketing Sales Prediction

This repository contains code for analyzing TV marketing data and building a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV advertising budgets.

## Overview

The provided Jupyter Notebook explores and analyzes a dataset ('tvmarketing.csv') related to TV marketing budgets and corresponding sales figures. It covers the following key aspects:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- Visualizations of data distributions, correlations, and pair plots.
- Simple Linear Regression modeling with scikit-learn.

## Usage

The provided Jupyter Notebook ('TV_Marketing_Sales_Prediction.ipynb') can be run in a Python environment with Jupyter installed. To use this code:

1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/TV-Marketing-Sales-Prediction.git
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code cells sequentially for analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Files Included

- `TV_Marketing_Sales_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, modeling, and evaluation code.
- `tvmarketing.csv`: Dataset used for analysis (TV marketing data).

## Model Evaluation

The linear regression model's performance metrics are calculated, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
